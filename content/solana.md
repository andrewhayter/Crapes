# Solana Development

Solana is a high-performance blockchain that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications. It uses a unique timestamp system called Proof of History and a novel sharding solution known as Turbine to achieve high throughput and low latency.

## Getting Started with Solana

To start developing with Solana, you need to install the Solana tool suite, which includes the Solana CLI, the Solana keygen tool, and the Solana test validator.

```bash
npm install -g @solana/web3.js
```

## Building a Solana DApp

Building a decentralized application (DApp) on Solana involves writing smart contracts in Rust or C and deploying them to the Solana blockchain.

Here is a basic example of a Solana smart contract written in Rust:

```rust
use solana_program::{
    account_info::{next_account_info, AccountInfo},
    entrypoint,
    entrypoint::ProgramResult,
    msg,
    pubkey::Pubkey,
};

entrypoint!(process_instruction);

fn process_instruction(
    program_id: &Pubkey,
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    _instruction_data: &[u8],
) -> ProgramResult {
    msg!("Hello, Solana!");
    Ok(())
}
```
