# Rust

Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but can guarantee memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references.

## Why Rust?

- **Performance**: Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient. With no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.

- **Reliability**: Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety.

- **Productivity**: Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, and top-notch tooling.

## Rust and Solana

Rust is the primary programming language used by the Solana blockchain. Solana is built in Rust for its speed, runtime efficiency, and memory safety.

## Rust and Anchor

Anchor is a framework for Solana’s Sealevel runtime providing several convenient developer tools. It is written in Rust and provides an IDL for interacting with programs, and a lower-level library for directly writing bytecode.

## Getting Started with Rust

To get started with Rust, you can follow the official [Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
