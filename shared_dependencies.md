The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for server-side rendering and routing. It is used in all the `.tsx` files.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so all `.tsx` files will also share React dependencies.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used for type checking and improved developer experience. It is used in all `.tsx` and `.ts` files.

4. **CSS Modules**: CSS Modules are used for styling the components. They are used in the `styles/globals.css` and `styles/Home.module.css` files.

5. **Node.js and npm**: Node.js is the runtime environment and npm is the package manager used for managing all the dependencies of the project. They are used in the `package.json` file.

6. **Markdown**: Markdown is used for creating the content files. It is used in the `content/solana.md`, `content/anchor.md`, and `content/rust.md` files.

7. **Common Components**: There might be common React components that are used across different pages. These components will be shared among the `.tsx` files.

8. **Common Functions**: There might be common utility functions that are used across different files. These functions will be shared among the `.tsx` and `.ts` files.

9. **Common Variables**: There might be common variables that are used across different files. These variables will be shared among the `.tsx` and `.ts` files.

10. **Common Styles**: There might be common styles that are used across different pages. These styles will be shared among the `.css` files.

11. **Common API Endpoints**: There might be common API endpoints that are used across different pages. These endpoints will be shared among the `.tsx` and `.ts` files.
